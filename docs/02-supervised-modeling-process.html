# Introduction

This module introduces concepts that are useful for any type of machine learning model:

- modeling process versus a model

- data splitting

- nuances of the R modeling ecosystem

- resampling

- bias-variance trade-off

- model evaluation

&lt;br&gt;

.center.bold[Many of these topics will be put into action in later sections.]

# Overview

.pull-left[

* the machine learning process is very iterative and heurstic-based 

* common for many ML approaches to be applied, evaluated, and modified before a final, optimal model can be determined

* A proper process needs to be implemented to have confidence in our results

__Generalizability__: we want an algorithm that not only fits well to our past data, but more importantly, one that .blue[predicts a future outcome accurately].

- .bold[Training Set]: these data are used to develop feature sets, train our algorithms, tune hyper-parameters, compare across models, and all of the other activities required to reach a final model decision.

- .bold[Test Set]: having chosen a final model, these data are used to estimate an unbiased assessment of the model’s performance (generalization error).

# What's the right split?

* typical recommendations for splitting your data into training-testing splits include 60% (training) - 40% (testing), 70%-30%, or 80%-20%

* as data sets get smaller ( `\(n&lt;500\)` ):
   - spending too much in training (*&gt; 80%*) won’t allow us to get a good assessment of predictive performance. We may find a model that fits the training data very well, but is not generalizable (overfitting),
   - sometimes too much spent in testing (*&lt; 40%*) won’t allow us to get a good assessment of model parameters

* as *n* gets larger ( `\(n&gt;100K\)` ):
   - marginal gains with larger sample sizes
   - may use a smaller training sample to increase computation speed

* as *p* gets larger ( `\(p \geq n\)` )
   - larger samples sizes are often required to identify consistent signals in the features

---
# Mechanics of data splitting .red[<span>&lt;i class="fas  fa-hand-point-right faa-horizontal animated " style=" color:red;"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</span> code chunk 2]

Two most common ways of splitting data include:

* .bold[simple random sampling]: randomly select observations

* .bold[stratified sampling]: preserving distributions
   - &lt;u&gt;classification&lt;/u&gt;: sampling within the classes to preserve the distribution of the outcome in the training and test sets
   - &lt;u&gt;regression&lt;/u&gt;: determine the quartiles of the data set and sample within those artificial groups

1. Use __rsample__ to split the Ames housing data (`ames`) and the Employee attrition data (`churn`) using stratified sampling and with a 70% split.

   ```r
   # ames data
   set.seed(123)
   ames_split &lt;- initial_split(ames, prop = _____, strata = "Sale_Price")
   ames_train &lt;- training(_____)

   churn_split &lt;- initial_split(churn, prop = _____, strata = "Attrition")
   churn_train &lt;- training(_____)

2. Verify that the distribution between training and test sets are similar.

.center.bold.font110.red[_We can get around these inconsistencies with meta-engines_]

---
# Many engines

With the prevelance of ML packages available, this results in an abundance of direct and meta engines that can be used.

For example, the following all produce the same linear regression model output:


```r
lm_lm    &lt;- lm(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_train)
lm_glm   &lt;- glm(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_train, family = gaussian)
lm_caret &lt;- train(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_train, method = "lm")
```

* `lm()` and `glm()` are two different engines that can be used to fit the linear model
* `caret::train()` is a meta engine (aggregator) that allows you to apply almost any direct engine with `method = ?`

---
# Many engines

* Using direct engines provides .green[more flexibility] but

* requires you to be familiar with .red[syntax nuances]

## RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value.
## The final value used for the model was k = 6.

# plot cross validation results
ggplot(knn_fit$results, aes(k, RMSE)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)

# Putting the process together

.center.bold.font120.red[Is this the best predictive model we can find?]

* We may have identified the  optimal _k_-nearest neighbor model for our given data set but this doesn't mean we've found the best possible overall model.  

* Nor have we considered potential feature and target engineering options.  

* The remainder of this workshop will walk you through the journey of identifying alternative solutions and, hopefully, better performing models.
